👻  Spookily enough, opening VSCODE seemed to magically fix them. I literally didn't touch anything or do anything...

# Tour of Heroes — My Little Pony Flavored & Using Kendo UI! 

![kendoka for angular plus mlp](https://p192.p3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/rRu7OBlg/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-27%20at%2012.53.56%20PM.png?v=a47c8028358bc533908f0b9545f14087 "kendoka plus my little pony logo")

This is the Angular Tour of Heroes app with Kendo UI for Angular added in. I replaced the default heroes with MLP characters for added fun!
